Answers for Lab 3
-----------------------------------------------

EXERCISE 1

The exercise demonstrated a generic printer class. This example sent the wrapper class for primitives like integers, double values and terminated character arrays.
Would the GenericPrinter class work on user created classes like Person?
If so, then what would be printed out if the Person class did not have a toString method defined?
It will work on the user created classes like Person, but if the toString() method does not exist
It will return the address of the Person object.

EXERCISE 2

Write out your answer to the question 7. D.):
How many swaps must be made to correctly reverse the array?
up to the median - 1, therefore int data of the this.count/2

Would the code been more or less efficient if you used a second array and just copied the connects of each element into their new position (i.e. original_array[0] to new_array[n], original_array[1] to new_array[n-1], original_array[2] to new_array[n-2], etc.) ?
Explain your conclusion (why or why not).
the code would be less efficient as declaring a second array takes up more memory than declaring a singular temporary variable.



EXERCISE 3

You were instructed to change the code to be more generic and to operate with any number of nodes, but were told that:
You cannot change the method signature (parameters). You also cannot add instance variables to the class.
If you were allowed to do this, what new instance variable would you add and to which class would you add this new instance variable?

I would create a nodeLength/nodeCounter instance variable which the user declare how many node they want to make
and create a for-loop based on that instance variable. (loops nodeLength times)

EXERCISE 4

In this exercise you were given a new class called DoubleLinkedNode. This class was different from the class used in Exercise 3 above.
Could the class DoubleLinkedNode from this exercise be used in Exercise three in place of LinearNode without any other changes to the code in Exercise 3? (i.e ONLY: Search/Replace LinearNode with DoubleLinkedNode in the BuildLinkedList class.)
If not, what other code would have to be changed?

Yes, the DoubleLinkedNode class can be used in the exercise three with the same code. 
As the DoubleLinkedList class has all the methods and instance variable contained in LinearNode class.
