Answers for Lab 2
-----------------------------------------------

EXERCISE 1

1. This question refers to variables data1 and data2 in class TestDataTypes. For each one of the following statements indicate whether the comparison will return the value true or false


data1 == data2: true or false?
	false
data1.intVar == data2.intVar: true or false?
	true
data1.charVar == data2.charVar: true or false?
	true
data1.boolVar == data2.boolVar: true or false?
	true
data1.doubleVar == data2.doubleVar: true or false?
	true
data1.varA == data2.varA: true or false?
	false
data1.varA.numItems == data2.varA.numItems: true or false?
	true
data1.varA.arrItems == data2.varA.arrItems: true or false?
	true
2. How many of your answers to question 1 were incorrect? 
	none
3. Why was the result of the last comparison true, even though arrays are non-primitive types?
	Since the address of the array was the same. The same array variable was used for data1 and data2, meaning that the address 
	they hold will be the same
EXERCISE 3

4. What causes the first compilation error?
	main is a static method, meaning that it cannot make direct reference to the attribute counter which is a non-static variable.
	That is because counter instance variable is only meaningful when the class is declared so it must be used as (object).counter 

EXERCISE 4

5. Why does program CountObjects prints a message indicating that only one object was created, even though the program created more than one object of class ClassC?
	Since the counter instance variable is is a non-static variable meaning that it is initialized and declared every time the 
	object is created.
