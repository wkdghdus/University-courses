Answers for Lab 8
-----------------------------------------------

EXERCISE 1

1. What is the type of Exception being thrown? Why is this occurring?
it throws ClassCastException since c1 (otherObject) is a Card Object which does not
implement the Comparable interface.


2. After adding the "implements Comparable<Card>" into the class definition, why is there now a compiler-error?
The type Card must implement the inherited abstract method Comparable<Card>.compareTo(Card)
Since the Card class does not implement the Comparable ADT, in other words it does not have compareTo method


EXERCISE 2

3. After multiplying the return value by -1 in compareByName(), how are the names being sorted? Why is this happening?
the name was sorted in a reverse order.


EXERCISE 3

4. Why is the list of cities being shown in this order initially?
Since the compareTo method always returns 0, the order is never sorted.



5.
a) Initially, does the order in which the cities are added to the list affect the order in which they are stored in the list?
yes, since the compareTo method always returns 0, the element will be added to the front of the list.


b) After completing compareTo(), does the order in which the cities are added to the list affect the order in which they are stored in the list?
No, since the order are modified when added through a proper compareTo method.
